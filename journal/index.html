            <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
            <date>February 9, 2023</date>

            <p>The best way to get users' attention is the use of imagery; pictures can convey the same amount of information as a paragraph but also have a form of visual appeal and interest. But it can't be just any graphic: the image has to have a hidden meaning or story to it that users must take a closer look to find. This one value is something I'm focusing on for my Every Picture project. I want to communicate mainly with not just text but instead with imagery. However, I think I want to make the imagery a little bit confusing. Another topic that the article inspires my website is that ideally my website will force users to ask observation questions and experiment with how to navigate through the website. By doing so they'll immerse themselves in the narrative and engage more with the material I will convey. In addition to this, since the website will mainly represent part of my interests, I hope other people will relate to it and help start conversations based on those potential similarities.</p>

            <p>A website I found that utilizes imagery in a unique way is <a href="https://www.sergiodiazschiaffino.com/">Sergio Schiaffino's portfolio.</a> His use of imagery stands out in comparison to other portfolios. His usage of designing his portfolio is a callback to retro computers with his website being divided to desktop icons and the navigation bar being the top bar of an old macOS. This design choice isn't clear in why it was specifically designed that way; it forces users to ask observation questions. Why exactly did Schiaffino design the website the way it is? Does he like retro computers? Questions like these help engage users more with the website and help them get to know the designer better.</p>

            <h2>Overlay Design Pattern Research</h2>
            <date>February 7, 2023</date>

            <p>I read Naema Baskanderi's Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows and what I've learned is that an overlay is a great tool if you want to grab a user's attention for a brief moment. This pattern combined with the lightbox effect where the main page is blackened out is a powerful tool, but misusing it can hinder the user flow of the website which can damper user experience. Similar to form design, the best practices for overlay design were concepts I've already seen in action. Seeing the actual justifications behind the concepts however was helpful to know. Since I'm still focused on learning basic web design, it's pretty common to forget that the end goal is creating useful web design that provides a smooth and logical user experience.</p>

            <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
            <date>February 2, 2023</date>

            <p>A lot of the content the article discusses were details I already knew or had observed in multiple websites, but I never knew about the specific reasonings behind each practice. One practice that surprised me the most was the stigma behind inline labels for forms. I always thought that the subtle label inside the box looked aesthetically pleasing, but I never considered the user experience behind the practice and how it might be a point of frustration for users. Same thing with asking for sensitive information as people are wary of giving away personal information unless we give them a valid explanation and reason. This was a good reminder that we should always think about who will consume our design rather than tunnel visioning through our perspectives as designers only.</p>

            <p>A good website I consider to exemplify good practices is Miro. Although it does have an inline label, when you select it with your mouse the label smoothly transitions over to the top of the form box which is the best of both worlds.</p>

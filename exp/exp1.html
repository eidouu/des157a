        var poundTriangle = ["#", "##", "###", "####", "#####", "######", "#######",]

        for (var i = 0; i < 7; i++){
                console.log(poundTriangle[i]);
        }

        /* This program creates a triangle of pound symbols in the console log. I used both an array and a for loop together to make this triangle. I created an array where item zero is one pound, the next is two pounds, next is three pounds, and so on. Using a for loop with the intialize counter at 0, condition is that i isn't greater than 8, and i increases by 1 each time the loop runs. 
        
        When the loops runs for the first time, i will still be zero as it hasn't incremented yet. The console.log(poundTriangle[i]) works so that whatever number i is, it will print its corresponding item in the array. Since i is zero and arrays count starting from 0, the first item that will print is the first item of the array, which is "#". In the second time the loop runs, i updates to be 1 due to the incrementor and the same thing happens again except now "##" will be printed in the console log as it's numbered 1 in the array. This continues until i reaches 8, which doesn't even matter as the array only has 7 items.
        
        Overall I'm pretty sure there is an easier way to do this at least from what I vaguely remember from previous coding classes I've taken. If the assignment required the last line of the triangle to have a 100 pound symbols, there are ways to automate that instead of creating an array with a hundred items.*/
